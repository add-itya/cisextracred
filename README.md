how to run: Make sure python is successfully installed and working on the IDE of your choice.
I use VsCode and open the terminal in the directory and run "python3 ec.py" to run my file

How assignment should be modified: The only part that was unclear was how to structure the main function/test the class.
I think that providing a test suite or encouraging students to write their own tests that show each of the requirements could
be beneficial. In my case, i just copied the example usage that was shown in Figure 2 to show that my code works. Or, maybe the testing suite could be provided to the students that tells them which part of the tests failed so that they can debug and grades can be rolled out quickly as well (standardized language and appropriate testing suite).
